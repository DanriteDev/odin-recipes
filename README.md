# odin-recipes
My odin project is to create a landing page called odin-recipes, I should use the usual boilerplate HTML, and add a basic H1 heading. 

Next I must generate at least 3 additnal pages which online recipes to follow. 

use <ul> for the ingredents while using <ol> for the Steps needed to make the dish.

All these recipes must be linked to the home page.
